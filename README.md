# weatherApp

This is a desktop application built with Electron, a framework that helps create desktop apps using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I created a small window that displays the weather and temperature of a specific location. I used the Open-Meteo API. What makes this application different is the appearance of a pixelated animal, as if it were a companion pet.
